# Hay Day Strategy Simulator 🚜🌾👨‍🌾

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes and simulates optimal strategies in the mobile game **Hay Day**, focusing on player level as the main constraint.  
The goal is to recommend which products to produce at different levels based on efficiency metrics like profit per minute and XP gain.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Collect Hay Day product data (ingredients, production times, level unlocks, profit, XP).  
- Use **web scraping** and manual data collection to build a structured dataset.  
- Simulate production strategies for players at different levels.  
- Visualize results to compare **profit-focused** vs. **XP-focused** strategies.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (for scraping, analysis, and simulation)    
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data wrangling + calculations)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualizations)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (analysis + exploration)

## 🚀 Next Steps  
1. Scrape product and recipe data from the Hay Day Wiki.  
2. Build a dataset with level requirements, times, and profit margins.  
3. Run analysis to find the most efficient products by level.  
4. Create visualizations and a short presentation for deliverables.  

## ✨ Learning Goals  
- Gain experience with **web scraping** and dataset creation.  
- Practice applying the **data science process** end-to-end.  
- Improve skills in simulation, visualization, and project design.
